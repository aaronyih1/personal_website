      <p>Link to inactive but interactive <a href="/gftdream">site</a>.</p>
      <p>We presented users with two textfields: 1. for them to detail their hopes and dreams and 2. for their email address. We provided no instructions except for "let's chase your dream...describe it here".</p>
      <p>We had around 60 responses. Some of them were pretty shocking, some of them heartwarming, and others, still, just totally spammy.</p>
      <p>We responded to their dream requests with resources and roadmaps on how to make their dreams a reality. Many of the recipients did not reply to the first message, and of the few who did, only a small fraction continued to converse with us, and all of them stopped responding sooner or later.</p>
      <p>Dreams motivate us; they give us purpose and meaning, enabling us to become the best version of ourselves. As a result, dreams are deeply personal, private forces in our lives. For that reason, I was surprised to find how open people were to sharing not only their dreams but a method of contact, too.</p>
<!--       <p>It is obvious that there's a lot of people who feel stagnant in their lives, who have a dream but have stopped pursuing them </p> -->
