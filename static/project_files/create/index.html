      <p>Every single day we open hudreds of browser windows that allow us to peer into other worlds hosted on the internet. But why should something we see so often be so lifeless? For fear of becoming lifeless myself, I conceived the create. chrome extension.</p>
      <p>This project is significant because it was the first finsihed product that I had ever created with html, css, and javscript. I had been trying to learn how to build websites for a while at that point, but I found the overarching architecture of websites hard to wrap my head around.</p>
      <p>The simplified structure that the chrome extension allowed, enabled me to get a grip on fundamentals of web development. It fueled my interest in building websites and taught me how to learn. It all started here.</p>
