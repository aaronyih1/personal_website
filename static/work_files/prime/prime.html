      <p>From the technology involved in creating the boxers to the socially responsible mission, prime is through and through a boxer for this generation's men.</p>
      <p>The decisions made in this design are intended to support this singular message of universal modernity. The wordmark's typeface  is clean, sleek, and advanced with rounded that make the design slightly more friendly.</p>
      <p>The subtitle grounds the wordmark and adds an air of sophistication to backup prime's future-looking persepctive.</p>
      <p>We played around with renaming the brand rooted, but in the end, we agreed that it felt too traditional for the message we were going for, so we scrapped it for "prime," Prime Boxers.</p>
