      <p>This was my first official design internship. "Design" was even in my title (Visual Design Intern) and everything.</p>
      <p>The internship lasted 20hrs/week for 10 weeks during the Fall Quarter of 2016. Over the couse of which, my work reached pretty much every team at Enrou (from social media to blog and merchandise teams). </p>
      <p>I designed panorama images on the front page for both mobile and desktop, email templates, social media content (on facebook, pinterest, and instagram), pitch decks, webpages, and even got the chance to dev some of these designs.</p>
