      <p>Why do we enjoy food so much? Why is America's obesity rate so high? What does it mean to indulge? Is indulgence a bad thing?</p>
      <p>No one <em>needs</em> nutella, yet our world loves it. In 160 countries, 365,000 tons of nutella are consumed every year<sup><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2639203/How-Britain-went-nuts-spread-health-police-HATE-Sales-Nutella-soar-22-cent-Britain-sales-worth-30million.html">1</a></sup>. That's like 2 million pounds of nutella a day.</p>
      <p>Nutella is mostly composed of sugar and oil, two calorically dense ingredients that were in short supply when our ancestors were hunting and foraging. But now that times have changed, and sugar and oil are pretty much always available, we as a species have been slow to adapt to circumstances.</p>
      <p>In a way, the world's obesity epidemic is the result of uninformed, uncontrolled, and unleashed desire. The Bodies & Nutella event served to explore several facets of desire including: sexual, physiolgical, and egotistical desire.</p>
      <p>The results were surprising. Before we had even finished covering the floor with yesterday's issue of the Daily Bruin, people stripped and readied their bodies for the nutella spread. Throughout the event people touched, licked, and rubbed nutella on, from, and atop each other.</p>
      <p>Sometimes all people need is an excuse to let their unfiltered desires run wild. </p>
