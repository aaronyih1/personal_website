      <p>They asked me to improve their trifold brochure design by 12 am the next night. I was familiar with their design identity because I have seen their content around campus and because I know the founder through my frat.</p>
      <p>A strong but subtle motif that BoxCamp uses throughout their material is night and day. Often, the front of the flyer will be day and the back will be night, suggesting that your boxes will be safe day and night. I was immediately impressed when I noticed this, so I wanted to keep this in the design.</p>
      <p>Overall, the layout of the brochure was done quite well, so I kept most of it the same. I did align some key features like the bounding lines on the left with the top of the logo and the bottom of the URL. I rearranged some of the icons to stress hierarchy as well as added a photo to bring life to the physical address provided.</p>
      <p>The most pressing issue with the old design was the typography. The type itself was not consistent with BoxCamp's millenial-focused identity. The serif font made the brochure seem dated, and the center aligned body text made it seem formalâ€”not the vibe BoxCamp is going for.</p>
      <p>I selected San Fransisco, and used it to replace the 4 other fonts that were used prior. Immediately, the brochure became less about what indesign can do and more about what BoxCamp can.</p>
